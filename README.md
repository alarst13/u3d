**U3D Adversarial Perturbations for Video Recognition**

This repository provides an implementation of the black-box attack framework based on Universal 3D (U3D) perturbations, as proposed in the paper [Universal 3-Dimensional Perturbations forBlack-Box Attacks on Video Recognition Systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.04284.pdf). U3D perturbations are 3-dimensional noise patterns designed to subvert deep neural network models used in video recognition systems. The attack is transfer-based, allowing it to target multiple DNN models without accessing the target model directly. U3D perturbations ensure human-imperceptibility and can efficiently attack real-time video recognition systems.
